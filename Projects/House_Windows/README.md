# HouseWindow 

The program draws a two-story house with open windows. 

## Installation

Please install the four required .jar files from the textbook's website. 

## Deficiencies

The internal emitted light from the hexagonal bipyramid is contributing too much to 
the ambient light, and all surfaces are reflecting such dim yellow light at certain angles.
